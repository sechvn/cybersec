Instructions
In Assignment 3 we are going to gain some experience with lists, dictionaries, and container classes.

We have been hired by ESPN to write a program which tracks all the players in the NFL.  We are going to create a Team container class to track the players on individual teams.  A template to begin the project has been provided for you to download.  Specifics:

Each team will be an instance of our Team container class
Team is implemented as a list
Each player will be represented by a dictionary
The list will hold a collection of players - each entry will be a unique dictionary
Expectations:

Your program works
Your program has a header (at the top) which contains Program Name, Author Name, Date Created, & High Level Description
The program is well-documented (docstrings for each method)
Comments are included in code to explain major processing steps
Grading Rubric:

20 points â€“ program is well documented
20 points for each method
Submit you updated ESPN.py to Brightspace for evaluation.
