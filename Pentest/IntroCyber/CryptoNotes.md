# Crypto Notes - Solar Winds Example

- Secure systems and software distribution must incorporate secure signing cryptographic methods.
- Defense in depth applied to software development life cycle.
- Digitally signed malware was used in update pushed to Orion management platform.
- Was the malware signed with SolarWinds keys and certificates?
- Software is digitally hashed usually using public key cryptography. 
- Taking place at runtime the hash signature is compared against or verified against a database checking whether or not the library or software came from trusted source.
- Once verified the cryptographic hash is regenerated then compared against the signed hash. 
- Public/Private key pairs use either RSA or ECDSA to perform the code signing.
- Private key is secret and held by signer, public key is distributed with OS or software. Public keys can be also signed creating web of trust model. Ensuring key hasn't been revoked by developer or vendor.
- Malware is increasingly signed by compromised certificates, forged hashes, and "hacking" certificate signing authorities.
- How was digitally signed malware distributed through the Orion platform?
- Weak credentials likely provided the attackers with access to the release system or software supply platform.
- Hash collision is usually prevalent in older algorithms. So probably not a factor in the Solar Winds hack.
- Whether SolarWinds certificates were used to sign the certificates or not, signed binaries were distributed through SolarWinds infrastructure.
- Bottom line whether or not software is developed offline using a hardware security module and two factor authentication with a trusted individual, more must be done to prevent future attacks.
- The entire development security operational pipeline needs to be evaluated. One recommendation is to use securely signed release packages verifying contents before signing.
