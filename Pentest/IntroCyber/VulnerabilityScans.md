# Vulnerability Scanning

- A penetration test is a single event using a manual process that is too often performed only to comply with regulatory requirements. (cengage)
- A vulnerability scan is frequent and ongoing process, often automated, that continuously identifies vulnerabilities and monitors cybersecurity progress. (cengage)
- Regulatory compliance laws, standards, and regulations included the Dodd-Frank Act, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), HIPPA, FISMA, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
- Necessity of conducting pentests is to comply with regulations? Not only though.
- Necessity of conducting pentests is to comply with regulations? Not only though.
- A standard is a collection of requirements specific to a system or procedure that must be met by everyone.
- A guideline is a collection of suggestions that should be implemented. 
- A policy is a document that outlines specific requirements or rules that must be met.
-  A security policy is a recorded document that states how an organization plans to protect the company's information technology assets. 
- Organization's information security policy can serve several functions.
- Data classification are labels assigned to assets based on importance AKA sensitivity level.
- Asset inventory is a list of systems created prior to scanning.
[Nessus] 
- Nessus allows discovery of both hardware and software assets if no inventory exists.
- Scanning frequency should be continual but technical and workflow interruptions can constrain this optimal choice.
- PCI DSS requirement 11 states how often vulnerability scans must be performed.
- Risk appetite is an organization's appetite or tolerance for exposure.
- Active scanning should not be used on ICS, IoT, and medical devices.
- "As a result, advanced vulnerability scanning tools and processes have recently been introduced to reflect the changes in IT. A new category of security tools, sometimes called _cyber exposure platforms_, are specifically designed to continuously perform asset inventory and then assess not only traditional IT infrastructures and devices but also cloud, mobile, IoT, and other assets across the organization. In addition, these tools can help quickly evaluate vulnerabilities, prioritize issues, help employees take appropriate corrective steps, and finally measure and report on the vulnerability from both a technical and business perspective"
- "vulnerability scan software updating includes plug-in updates, vulnerability feeds, and using the Security Content Automation Protocol."
- "_signature-based monitoring_ because it compares activities against a predefined signature. Signature-based monitoring requires access to an updated database of signatures along with a means of actively comparing and matching current software against a collection of signatures."
- Some of the best-known vulnerability feeds are the following:

-   NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
    
-   Mitre Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
    
-   CERT Vulnerability Notes Database
    
-   VulnDB
-   The [Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)], pronounced _S-Cap_, is an open standard that enables an automated vulnerability management, measurement, and policy compliance evaluation. SCAP is a suite of selected open standards that performs the following functions:

-   It enumerates software flaws, security-related configuration issues, and product names.
    
-   It measures systems to determine the presence of vulnerabilities.
    
-   It provides mechanisms to rank (score) the results of these measurements in order to evaluate the impact of discovered security issues.
-   While the scope represents the breadth of the scan, the [sensitivity level] is the depth of a scanâ€”in other words, the type of vulnerabilities being searched for.
-   Server based vs. agent-based (push) vs. pull (server). Agent based is becoming popular as it tends to have less impact on the network.
-   But agents could become targets for attackers.
