- Keys hjkl are used to navigate around the file.
- The V key is to enter visual mode where you can use navigation keys to highlight the text for deleting or copying and pasting. 
- The I key is insert mode where you can normally write text. In this mode you can copy and paste into the file from system clipboard by entering ctl + shift + v
- While in visual mode you can delete highlighted text by using the "d" key. You can then use the "y" key to yank or copy text to the vim clipboard. You then use the "p" key to paste that text from the vim clipboard.
