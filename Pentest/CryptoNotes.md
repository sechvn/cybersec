# Crypto Notes - Solar Winds Example

- Secure systems and software distribution must incorporate secure signing cryptographic methods.
- Defense in depth applied to software development life cycle.
- Digitally signed malware was used in update pushed to Orion management platform.
- Was the malware signed with SolarWinds keys and certificates?
- Software is digitally hashed usually using public key cryptography. 
- Taking place at runtime the hash signature is compared against or verified against a database checking whether or not the library or software came from trusted source.
