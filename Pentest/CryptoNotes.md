# Crypto Notes - Solar Winds Example

- Secure systems and software distribution must incorporate secure signing cryptographic methods.
- Defense in depth applied to software development life cycle.
- Digitally signed malware was used in update pushed to Orion management platform.
- Was the malware signed with SolarWinds keys and certificates?
- Software is digitally hashed usually using public key cryptography. 
- Taking place at runtime the hash signature is compared against or verified against a database checking whether or not the library or software came from trusted source.
- Once verified the cryptographic hash is regenerated then compared against the signed hash. 
- Public/Private key pairs use either RSA or ECDSA to perform the code signing.
- Private key is secret and held by signer, public key is distributed with OS or software. Public keys can be also signed creating web of trust model. Ensuring key hasn't been revoked by developer or vendor.
