# Data Correlation Types

- Conditional Analysis: Single or multi-conditional analysis tries to determine if specific events have occurred based on a predefined rule set. It is not considered robust or flexible enough to detect the wide variety of attacks that can occur.
- Signature Analysis: A method for data correlation that examines network traffic, activity, transactions, or behavior looking for well-known patterns of attack signatures. It compares activities against a predefined signature. Weaknesses include signature databases needing to be constantly updated and definitions not being specific enough or too specific to miss slight variations or produce false positives. Signature analysis is useless against zero-day attacks.
- Anomaly Analysis: designed for detecting statistical anomalies. Baseline is compiled over time then any deviation from the baseline produces an alarm. This can produce high number of false positives as normal behavior can change easily and quickly over time.
- Behavioral Analysis: attempts to overcome both anomaly analysis and signature based monitoring by being adaptive and proactive instead of reactive. Uses normal processes and actions as its standard. Continuously analyzes the behavior of processes and programs on a system and alerts the user if it detects any abnormal actions. It can stop new attacks more quickly than other types of analysis.
- Availability Analysis: examines whether a network device is properly functioning to provide resources to users. For example, an application server that is rejecting user login attempts would indicate an issue that needs attention.
- Trend Analysis: Looks for change or development over time to uncover a pattern. Looks at a change in the frequency of events, such as how often failed logins have occurred, which may indicate a threat actor attempting to use a stolen password. Can indicate for example a Dos attack. It also looks at a change in the volume of events. 
- Heuristic Analysis: This method is founded on experience-based techniques. It attempts to answer the question, Will this do something harmful if it is allowed to execute?
