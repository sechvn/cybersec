# Data Correlation Types

- Conditional Analysis: Single or multi-conditional analysis tries to determine if specific events have occurred based on a predefined rule set. It is not considered robust or flexible enough to detect the wide variety of attacks that can occur.
- Signature Analysis: A method for data correlation that examines network traffic, activity, transactions, or behavior looking for well-known patterns of attack signatures. It compares activities against a predefined signature. Weaknesses include signature databases needing to be constantly updated and definitions not being specific enough or too specific to miss slight variations or produce false positives. Signature analysis is useless against zero-day attacks.
- Anomaly Analysis: designed for detecting statistical anomalies. Baseline is compiled over time then any deviation from the baseline produces an alarm. This can produce high number of false positives as normal behavior can change easily and quickly over time.
- Behavioral Analysis: attempts to overcome both anomaly analysis and signature based monitoring by being adaptive and proactive instead of reactive.
