Instructions
In Assignment 4 we will tackle Chapter 4 Programming Exercise 1 - extend the LList class by implementing some of the other methods that the built-in Python list supports:  min, max, index, count, and remove.   The starter code from the book is attached and available to download.    Your task:

Complete each of these five methods.    Think about any required preconditions and be sure to document and test for them
Complete a unitttest which tests each of them.   Part of the challenge is to develop a complete set of tests for each method.  For example:  to test the .min() method, it should be able to find the minimum value when it is the first item, the last item, and somewhere in the middle.
Rubric for this assignment:

10 points - Your code is well-structured and properly documented
75 points - functionality is complete - 15 for each for each of the 5 methods
15 points for a unit test of the five new methods (3 points each)
Submit your two files, LList.py and LList_unittest.py, to Brightspace for evaluation.
