Instructions
In Assignment 2 you will tackle Chapter 2 Programming Exercise 10.  Specifically:

Complete the Rational class by adding methods for the following:

plus, minus, & divide operations, each of which returns a Rational ADT

the six comparison operators, each of which should return True or False 

Complete the unit test to test all the methods

For bonus points, have your class always store the fraction in reduced form. (Hint: use Euclid's GCD algorithm in the class constructor. )

Starter code is available in BrightSpace for you to download.   Expectations:

Your program works
Your program has a header (at the top) which contains Program Name, Author Name, Date Created, & High Level Description

Each function is well-documented (a Docstring describe what it does (specification) and includes the Pre & Post Conditions)

Comments are included in code to explain major processing steps

Grading Rubric:

Rational.py
10 points –well documented
40 points – functionality is complete
10 bonus points – store fraction in reduced form
Test_Rational.py
10 points –well documented
40 points – functionality is complete, tests exist for each function
Submit both Rational.py and Test_Rational.py to Brightspace.
