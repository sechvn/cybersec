Instructions
In Assignment 5 we will tackle a variation of Chapter 5 Programming Exercise 1 - write a Stack and Queue class.  Your task:

Implement a Queue ADT using a linked-list structure.   Hint:  rather than a single head, you will want to track both a head and tail of the linked list
Implement a Stack ADT, again using a linked-list structure.  
You must implement a linked-list version these ADTs -- solutions which simply use a Python list will have disappointing grade.

You do not need to implement a unit test for this assignment.  Attached you will find the following:

starter code for MyQueueADT.py and StackADT.py - you will make changes to both of these files
A complete ListNode.py to use as your linked list nodes - no changes are required to this file
A complete palindrome.py -- you may use this program to test your implementations
Rubric for this assignment:

10 points - Your code is well-structured and properly documented
45 points for the Queue ADT
45 points for the Stack ADT
Submit your two files, MyQueueADT.py and StackADT.py to Brightspace for evaluation. Do not change the names of these files or the class identifiers.

Please be sure to use the Discussion Topic for this week to ask any clarifying questions
