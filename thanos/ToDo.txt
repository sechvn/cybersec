Generate script
----------------
- Get input password
- Hash password with argon5
- Generate Fernet key
- Encrypt unlock password with fernet key
- Generate aesccm key/nonce
- Write all components to file as list


Extract for encryption
------------------------
- Read the cryptographic contents in the keys file
- Split components into list by newline
- Decrypt the password with the cryptographic key
- use the password with aesccm key nonce to encrypt contents


When user pays
---------------
- Read the cryptographic contents in the keys file
- Split components into list by newline
- Decrypt the password with the cryptographic key
- Display decrypted password


Unlock script
--------------
- Prompt user for unlock password to decrypt contents
- Read the cryptographic contents in the keys file
- Split components into list by newline
- Decrypt the password with the cryptographic key
- Verify the users input hash to decrypted stored password hash
- Once verified, use the password with aesccm key/nonce to decrypt contents
